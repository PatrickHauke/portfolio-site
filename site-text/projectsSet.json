Over the course of 28 hours, we built out a hardware prototype, and a simple web application that would display the location of a dog wearing the hardness. Out of 55 teams, we were one of 17 selected to present our ideas to judges. Although we did not win any challenges, I was personally awarded the Google MVP Award from Raymond Blum after the judges learned that I was helping a group competing against us.",

I assisted several teams and helped with event setup and breakdown over the course of 30 hours.",

We came up with the idea for Puppy Walk, an IOS application which could be used by dog walkers to track their dogs location through the use of a custom collar, keep a record of a dogs friends, and give warnings to owners when an aggressive dog may be nearby. I worked on developing the breadboard prototype of the collar which would talk to a web service and update the position in the IOS app.",

We took advantage of Facebook Messenger API, and HP Haven OnDemand Sentiment Analysis API to get a prototype built.",

With the first push from a close friend, I attended the event. I immediately began contributing more to the team than I thought Iâ€™d be capable of. We finalized an idea to build an Android application that could be used by tourists to find and support local business in Downtown Brooklyn. I became hooked on learning software development after finishing the event while being awake for 35 hours working.",
